# Buffalo-Route-33-Income-Disparity-Project



"
Because of the politics of its' construction,  Route 33 passes through relatively economically disadvantaged areas, and Route 33 disrupted communities in ways that were not positive.

Test the hypothesis that individuals living closer to Rt. 33 are likely to be less wealthy than average for the city.

There might be many ways to do this,   we will try to use data from Open Data Buffalo and geopandas to address the question.  

Here's the idea- find the census blocks that are close (say 300 feet) from the Kensington Expressway (Rt 33).   Then find the average household income for the census blocks close to the 33 from the 2017 census data on open data Buffalo.
